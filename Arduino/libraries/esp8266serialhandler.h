  * \brief      Header file of esp8266serialhandler library.
  * \details    This library provides facilities for handling the Serial connection with the ESP8266 device.
  *             One aim is to put an effort on producing efficient code once for all and then to provide an easy interface for the user.
  *             Another aim is to demonstrate a possible way of programming the ESP8266, for learning purpose.
  *             Literate programming from Donald E. Knuth shall be used in order to generate a clean and efficient code.
  *             For unavoidable comments, Doxygen standard shall be used.
